I think you guys should install an update where if you reach your open limit then you have to pay to open the app or website again. It doesn’t matter how much, just you have to pay. No, it should not be a pro feature, because people with pro are already paying a lot. This should be something that anyone who has the app is able to do. I also think you should make it for the computer, because that’s where a lot of people do their work or school, and that’s where a lot of distractions can be. Thanks for this great app! Love it :)",

    "text": "This app has been really helpful in reducing my screen time. This is the first one that I’ve used that I’ve stuck with for more then a couple days. Some of my favorite features include the weekly screen time report and telling me how many years of my life I’m getting back by reducing my screen time. Seeing the hours I spend on my phone added up into years gives me the perspective I need to stay motivated. Additionally I really enjoy the mini activities intended to give you a dopamine hit. There have been a couple times that I’ve put down my phone afterward instead of unlocking social media. There are several glitches in the app although an update was just released and may have addressed the issues. \n\nSide note: This app relies heavily on AI from my knowledge which makes me fairly uncomfortable. Although I made the choice to use this app my primary complaint about the AI is cynical language used in the game section intended to provide dopamine. I understand that it would be unreasonable to ask the company to remove the AI from the app but I do not want to engage this kind of language for no reason, especially in this section of the app I just completed a game that asks you to do basic math equations (addition and subtraction) and race against AI. I lost two times in a row and both times the app told me that the AI won and “Humanity is doomed”.  This kind of language and narrative encourages me not to use this app. If this expands to other parts of the app, I will likely cancel my subscription. I have enough other apps I can go on to have an existential crisis, I don’t need my screen time app to be added to that list.",

    "text": "I wanted to like this app, and when it’s working properly it’s great. However I’ve run across some issues, and customer service hasn’t been very helpful because they can only help you in a meaningful way if you have your Apple mail app installed and in use. I guess it’s the only way they can see your in-app experience which is highly unusual. Opal was opening clones of my old blocks every time I tried to create a new one, and yesterday it froze my screen limit at its max so that my apps are blocked when they shouldn’t be. I did every troubleshooting task that the AI chat suggested and none have worked.  I just can’t deal with jumping through hoops in order to contact customer service again, and this app costs $100 per year, so I’m deleting it because it’s not worth the money right now. If you want to use the free version I would recommend it but do not pay for a year of this app until they fix all their issues.",

    "text": "While I do think that blocking apps is an easy way to slowly cure my phone addiction, this app caused me too much stress due to its flaws. 👎🏼\nWhen I tried to block most of my apps, I obviously made an exception for the ones that were absolutely necessary. When I check the settings of the session on Opal, it says that they're not blocked, but when I try to click on it, it won't let me, demonstrating that the app has a clear flaw or bug. Why would it say my app isn't blocked when it clearly is? I thought deleting it and reinstalling it would help, but after a day, Opal went right back to blocking it alongside the rest of the apps. This is extremely frustrating because it made me unable to access the apps that are crucial to my day to day life, unless I stopped the session completely, freeing all of the apps that I'm trying to limit in my life, so what is the point of using Opal then? It honestly wouldn't be such an issue if it wasn't for the second flaw I kept experiencing; when I tried to take a Break from my session, I kept experiencing some sort of weird glitch, I would click to take a Break so I can use my important app, and Opal wouldn't do it. Each and every single time I tried to unlock my apps, I would have to do the process 2-3 times in order for it to work, which is annoying because obviously Opal makes you wait a few seconds/do a puzzle before you can get the option to unlock your apps. At one point, it simply wouldn't work and I didn't have the option to be patient with it because I had to use my crucial app in order to go about my business, I had no time to deal with the glitches and the puzzles. I deleted Opal and I have to learn to deal with my addiction in a different way. It's hard because I am constantly caught in the loop of consuming content and forgetting what I initially grabbed my phone for, but I am being forced to be more self aware and recognize how the endless scrolling starts, and the mechanisms that occur in my brain that I need to work on to finally be free from this addiction. So thanks for that, I guess I will have to grow to be more disciplined. But I was incredibly disappointed in Opal's glitches that I don't think I will ever download this app again unless it is resolved. I do see know value that it can have if it is functional, though.",

Where are you getting data from Apple (so I can delete it)? Don't know. Srsly?! Yes.\n\nDon't worry: people have been complaining about this problem for a while.\n\nSO. If you don't have sites/don't use Safari, I think this is great! If you do and only want to block 50 websites (or everything), great! If you just want to block apps?

    "text": "Yeah it’s been a couple weeks since I got this. It’s good because I have very little self control when it comes to doomscrolling but I still want the benifits that social media gives me. I tried using the screentime thing in settings on my phone to only give me 30 min a day, but time would run out when I didn’t get on social media at all. So I knew the Opal app has the option to set specific times of the day to be locked put of social media, so that’s ammune to the glitch. I have been happier since I am not killing my spirit with social media, and so rhis has been useful!! There was a glitch where sometimes it doesn’t accually lock me out of social media when I am supposed to, and so I started doomscrolling and it ruined my day. But it’s technecally my responsability, but an issue on the app. I really like the pretty opals, I really enjoyed breaking them to reviel the opals that I earned, but it stopped letting me break them after a few and it was dissapointing. Can you please let me break all the opals that I earn? It’s really satisfying. Thank you.",

Users can:\n•repeatedly use unlocks\n•change limits or schedules after enforcement starts\n•revoke Screen Time permissions and re-enable later\n\n…without any persistent history or consequence inside the app. That makes it easy to undermine your own rules quietly, which defeats the purpose for serious users.\n\nWhat would make this a 5-star app:\n•an accountability history (unlock usage, schedule adherence, rule changes)\n•logging Screen Time permission revocations/restores\n•an integrity metric (did I keep my word or not)\n•brief, optional reflection prompts at key moments (before unlocks, after rule changes)\n•weekly summaries focused on accountability, not just usage minutes\n•a place to define and revisit why you’re limiting apps, so behavior change is internal, not just enforced\n\nBlocking alone changes behavior temporarily.\nAccountability, integrity tracking, and reflection change it long-term.\n\nIf these additions were made, this would easily be a 5-star app.",

    "text": "Is it a collecting rock and gems mini-game of a focus / productivity app? It's a focus app, but the gemstones take up about 50% of my home page when I open the app, how distracting for a focus app. Why is that even a thing? Not to mention you need to pay to fully block access to those apps completely, otherwise you can just ignore.. Focus section is pretty useless as well, if you have any self-control, you can sit your phone down, and not doomscroll while working. Apples system is honestly superior with much less features. I see nothing special, just a lot of random features thrown in to an app. Such as the gemstones, streaks, the whole home screen, there's a lot of useless things in the app, every page. As a young adult with self control (most of the time), who limits social media to 1 hour a day, this app does very little for me, except give me gemstones to collect! \nGiving it 2 star because it at least has some good features in PRO. Although would be a 1 star if PRO version didn't exist, since it would be reductant compared to Apples.",

    "text": "You read that right. Whether you like it or not. You need this my friend. As humans, we spend on average 8-10 hours on our phones. Mindless scrolling, feeling overwhelmed and anxious. Screen time tapping into your social life. Avoiding school work. Avoiding, everything. \n\nI don’t know if it’s just me, I feel so guilty, this horrible nervous feeling, gut wrenching feeling after scrolling for 4+ hours. I feel inhumane. So out of touch with reality, with those around me. That “need” for a dopamine rush. we as humans are made for more than just this. \n\nGet up. Text your parents, friends, family you love them. Go outside. Read that book. Write down those endless stories in your mind. Listen to your body, drain your soul of negativity. \n\n\nAnyway folks, love you dude. Take care",

Was disappointed tho, that they’re taking the typical bogus approach to customer service by making themselves as unreachable to customers as possible. All I wanted was to send a quick message to the design team, and got stuck in some loop of community forums. I am not wasting my time on that BS. Seems rather ironic that a company claiming to help keep people off their screens would add layers of app garbage for what could just be a simple contact form— click and send. Disappointing. \n\nAnd all I had to say, as feedback, was that the backdrop has switched to an ocean scene, but it’s clearly something like AI. The sound doesn’t align with the scene, and it’s clearly a split screen-the same waves mirrored on both sides. Believe me, your customers do spend enough time in nature to know the difference between real ocean and fake. And I will not support AI in any way shape or form, so if this continues, you’ll have lost me.",

    "text": "I’ve been using and loving Opal for almost a year. I recommend it to everyone! I’ve had a “Sleep” block set up that entire time, but tonight I decided to try out the new sleep feature. Well, as I was fiddling with the settings, the clock clicked over to 9:00pm, triggering my sleep block to kick in. I hadn’t finished adding “always allowed” apps to the list before this happened (and I hadn’t realized EVERYTHING would be blocked vs just my block list!), and there was literally no way to pause the block to make edits. I couldn’t even google it because Safari was blocked! My baby monitor app had been blocked, which is an unacceptable safety issue. I ended up having to delete the app and lost a year of history/data/streaks just so I could access my baby monitor app. I’m really really frustrated, and honestly may not use Opal anymore as a result.",

HOWEVER, THIS APP PARTNERED WITH OUR DESIRE TO STOP ACTUALLY HAS ENOUGH BARRIERS THAT IT MAKES IT NOT WORTH IT TO GO THROUGH. This has been a GAME CHANGER for me and I couldn’t be more grateful. The important part for me is blocking the apps I used the most, which were consuming so much of my time and ruining my metal, ALL DAY LONG. Just screw it and block them the whole day right when you wake up until you go to sleep that way you don’t start your day out feeding your addiction. Then take breaks as needed for INTENTIONAL posting maybe or if you have a free moment. The first day I allowed myself 1 break just to post something. As the days went on and I would take 5-15 min breaks, I no longer wanted to watch the videos my friend were sharing let alone scroll through TikTok or Facebook to watch a bunch of them or read posts etc. Now, when I give myself a 5 or 15 minute break, I don’t even use the whole time. I check and realize how not worth it and uneventful it is and move on…. My creativity is back and I’m more present and settled in my mind. Thank you to whoever created this app 🙏🏻🥹",

That’s not why I opened the app! And why would an app try to prevent me from unlocking my apps automatically put me in a loading screen to open said apps?\n\n2) I can’t even see my screentime anymore. The front page is blank; I only see my rewarded gems. Even when I go to the dedicated screen time page, there’s nothing. What’s the point of the app, then? I might as well use the build in Apple screen time functions. \n\n3) can’t have a “block now” and a “schedule” running at the same time : /\nthe schedule gets snoozed until I stop the “block now” timer",

    "text": "It’s been super helpful having this. I’ve tried other blocking apps, but I always ended up disabling them. This one lets you set automatic start and stop times, and if you upgrade you get more app coverage. Even the free version lets you block whole categories like shopping, entertainment, and social media.\n\nI don’t really understand the gem part (I’m neurodivergent but I didn’t get that flavor 😅), but they’re shiny and satisfying to tap, breaking the rock off to reveal a pretty gem. It’s actually really smart, and yeah sometimes intentionally frustrating, that you have to do 30 seconds of deep breathing before you’re allowed to start a break and disable the blocking.\n\nI’ve even forgotten the timer was on some days. I went to online shop or scroll Facebook, realized everything was blocked, and even though I wasn’t busy I didn’t bother unblocking. I did something else instead.\n\nI love that it gives encouragement and sets realistic goals. Seeing the time I’ve saved and how many years of my life I could get back if I keep going is really cool.\n\nThanks developers! Amazing job.",

It also has an annoying 5 second countdown as you navigate the various screens in the app which seems a bit too much, I’m trying to be productive so let’s make it less performative and more useful of my time. Lastly, I needed to access LinkedIn during the workday and I unblocked the app but here I am 20 minutes later still not able to open LinkedIn.
