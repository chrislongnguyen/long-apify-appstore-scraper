    "text": "I’m a paying Cleft subscriber and the recent updates have introduced numerous bugs to iOS 18. It will attempt to start a recording automatically and then tell me it needs to be at least three word. When I attempt to view it and back out, the whole interface turns white and I have to force quit the app. I also can’t reliably get my audio to sync. And every time the app opens it shows me the most recent update patch notes.",
