    "text": "I fell in love with this app when it first came out and just lunged in and bought it for a year or whatever it was. It was good but it tended to rewrite your notes in a way that often left out a little bit of nuance and information. The new version is fantastic you can also go ahead and update notes afterwards as well as you make it incredibly useful, integrated with some automations and workflows this is a fantastic app and kudos to the solo developer who made it. I didn't use it for months when I got PLAUD, it's transcription and options were just so good but that's now falling behind badly, companies that grow that quickly tend to prioritize investors over customers and it's starting to show, the best worst feature of last year was PLAUD showing you are blocking advert 10 seconds before you're allowed to go and use the app, kind of killed its utility",

    "text": "Effortless, accurate, and surprisingly powerful —\nAudioPen  nails voice transcription. It doesn’t just capture what I say — it rewrites it into what I meant to say, trimming the fluff and filler like magic. Way better than voice memos or iOS dictation. Honestly shocked it’s not more popular. Edit: I’m an AudioPen Prime member and just love how easy it is to take notes. My favorite thing about this app though, and what sets it apart from similar apps, is the clean and gorgeous UX design. Everything just feels intuitive and seamless. Love it.",

It helps me capture my thoughts and then tuen them into something that is organized so I can write longer form essays.
