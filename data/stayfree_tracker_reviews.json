    "title": "This is my review for the IOS app",
    "text": "The App version honestly suck when you compare it to its desktop and website counterparts. To Keep it short, you cannot edit you limits once they are made, you cannot easily see usage from other devices on the app, the apps usage doesn’t show up on other devices either and if does it doesn’t shows the times for each app, rather just showing the total screen time. The list just goes on and on, I recommend ScreenZen as the main for Mobile this app as a secondary just so that you can have the opportunity to see your screen time on your other devices (even if it doesn’t show the times for different apps and website) and StayFree (this app) for desktop and Website. I have more recommendations to make the app better but the devs need to work on the foundation first which is catching up to the website and desktop version as well as checking out their competitors.",

    "text": "I absolutely adore the chrome extension it's one of the only things that's helped me get off my computer, so I decided to download it for my phone too! But I think it would work incredibly if it had as many obstacles as the chrome extension did and it was harder to delete the limits you set for yourself and I'd love to see it develop more",
