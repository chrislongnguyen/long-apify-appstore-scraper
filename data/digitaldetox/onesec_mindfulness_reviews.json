It seems to eventually get sorted out but lately (maybe since around ios26 release?) it’s been a recurring issue. \n\nAll of that said, this is still for me the best screen time app out there especially for the price.

Users can:\n\t•\trepeatedly use unlocks\n\t•\tchange limits or schedules after enforcement starts\n\t•\trevoke Screen Time permissions and re-enable later\n\n…without any persistent history or consequence inside the app. That makes it easy to undermine your own rules quietly, which defeats the purpose for serious users.\n\nWhat would make this a 5-star app:\n\t•\tan accountability history (unlock usage, schedule adherence, rule changes)\n\t•\tlogging Screen Time permission revocations/restores\n\t•\tan integrity metric (did I keep my word or not)\n\t•\tbrief, optional reflection prompts at key moments (before unlocks, after rule changes)\n\t•\tweekly summaries focused on accountability, not just usage minutes\n\t•\ta place to define and revisit why you’re limiting apps, so behavior change is internal, not just enforced\n\nBlocking alone changes behavior temporarily.\nAccountability, integrity tracking, and reflection change it long-term.\n\nIf these additions were made, this would easily be a 5-star app.",

    "text": "Some apps block you from completely accessing certain apps or websites. This forces you to be intentional about wanting to go onto them. I love the reinterventions, and forcing you to say how much time you want to spend before you go in, so you don’t look up at have 1 hour gone. Awesome app, best $20 I’ve ever spent. I use both the iPhone app and the chrome extension.",
