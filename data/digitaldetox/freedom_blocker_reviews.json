    "text": "Really appreciating Freedom so far. I love how versatile and customized the blocklists can be. The only thing I’ve run into so far that I wish was different is that when you go in to edit a blocklist, you can’t just see what apps are on the list. It shows how many apps are blocked, but not which ones, so you end up having to search through all the categories, or just remember which ones you blocked (in order to find and unblock them if needed). A little annoying, but overall, would recommend the app to anyone struggling with device use/abuse.",

    "text": "For months I had felt the keen need to go touch grass, figuratively speaking. The iphone screen time function was too easy for me to bypass, and even if I did abide by it, I’d get on my computer to scratch that itch for a dopamine hit.\n\nThat’s where Freedom helps. It doesn’t just block one app, it blocks all the apps you don’t want to be distracted by on all of your devices if you need to. I was finding that if I stopped using instagram, for example, I would just replace it with something else, like Reddit. Now, with the help of Freedom, I reach for my phone less, my screen time is down, I often don’t even notice that I don’t have access to certain apps because in general I’m using the less. And finally, I built up the courage to deactivate Instagram because Freedom helped me to wean myself off.\n\nI highly recommend this simple yet effective tool if you’re ready to live life off of your devices.",

It ONLY works on safari reliably, so anyone who has more than one browser on their phone effectively can’t use website blocking. For me that’s a big issue. For others it may not be an issue at all. I hope someday they support at least chrome.",
