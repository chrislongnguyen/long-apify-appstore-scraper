    "text": "I’ve used this app for several years, honestly it’s getting worse. Many glitches, bugs and crashes just become the norm. The dev cannot bother to add new features or simply add tree names to ui as many users suggested. The subscription is not worth it, just the same features repackaged so I can’t image how mad other paid users might feel when basic features got taken away for monetization. And guess what, even after I paid for the subscription, the app still ask me to watch ads when ads should’ve been removed for subscribed users. It feels like a scam and I’m considering switching to other productivity app.",

    "title": "Beautiful new UI + Ridiculous Negative Reviews",
    "text": "So I initially agreed with everyone complaining that we paid for the app so there should be no subscription model, but after using the app for a few days... \n1) Users are lying about being forced to subscribe. You can X out of it.\n2) The trees aren't locked behind the subscription at all. As far as I can tell you can buy them all with coins or gems which you can get from planting trees and participating in the challenges. I don't like the implication that people are making that all trees should just 'be free'. I do think they're overpriced in game currency tbh. 3x what they should cost. I'm an elixer buyer which doubles my coins and I still feel like they should be half. I've logged hours upon hours and only have enough for one nice tree as most are priced around 2000 and it's way harder to collect the gems. Still, I love being incentivized to actually use the app. The coin + gem + tree rewards, being able to see your own forest, and being able to plant real trees is all SUPER rewarding. \n\nThe new UI is stunning and I really like the new breathing buddy! I do think for people who paid for the app everything should either be purchasable by collecting game currency or free though. Specifically in the context of the other breathing scapes, I feel like they should be free or purchasable with game currency for paid users. I know in Canada they get the app for free so I understand it being different for them",

    "text": "Originally, after planting a tree, the Rest button was the most prominent at the bottom, making it simple to end the session, and back to main screen. Now Forest has replaced this with its Rest & Breathing Timer, since that button is still the most prominent one on the screen, it’s way too easy to mis-tap by accident. To make it even more frustrating, you have to long-press just to exit the Rest & Breathing Timer once you’ve mis-tapped it, which is such a counterintuitive, annoying design.\n\nWhat’s more, I really dislike that Forest requires you to open the app directly for all actions. I much prefer launching focus timers via Shortcuts, as it lets me start a session without any distractions. If Forest won’t add support for Shortcuts for a seamless start, it should at the very least polish the basic in-app experience—but this forced update only ruins it with poor design choices.",

It was $2, and helped me buy cute trees easier. When the Plus subscriptions started, I was a few days into an elixir, and signed up for Plus with the early bird sale ($35), thinking that the triple-coin benefit would just continue.\n\nNope. I haven't been getting my triple coin in a week even after paying $35 for the yearly subscription. I can't even buy an elixir to make up for this, because the app is SAYING I have triple coin but I'm not GETTING triple coin.\n\nNo problem, I can just message tech support. They were absolutely no help. Gave me 600 coin, what I would make in 2 or less days (that's how often I use this app), and told me I'm SOL before closing the ticket as \"resolved.\" \n\nI feel like I've been scammed. $35 for one of the most appealing features to be completely broken.",

    "text": "I’m really upset because about two months after I paid to download this app, multiple core features were removed and are now locked behind a monthly subscription.\n\nI have no issue with the app introducing a subscription for additional features. The problem is that I specifically paid for this app with the understanding that these features were included. Removing functionality that paying users already purchased feels lazy and scummy, especially when the alternative would be to simply add new premium features instead.\n\nSome features that were removed include:\n\t•\tThe ability to choose which apps are blocked during a focus period\n\t•\tViewing detailed focus stats (such as which days and times you focus most)\n\t•\tCreating and editing custom tags to label and group study sessions\n\nOn top of this, ads were added, and the app constantly pushes the subscription.\n\nI genuinely enjoyed this app and found it helpful, but it has now become a source of frustration. All I’m asking is that the features I paid for be returned, and that subscriptions enhance the experience for subscribers rather than restrict it for everyone else.",

Adding on new features that you can only pay to access when I already paid for the original app is so lame, it makes it feel like a money grab.

    "text": "I love this app and use it daily, but there is one issue I have with it. Currently, to grow your tree fully, you need to set your focus time for 120 minutes. But, research shows the importance of not sitting in one spot that long and true focus is optimized in shorter bursts of time. So, those of us who set our focus time to less than 120 min never get fully-grown trees. There should be a way that offsets that default if you continue to build your tree, but in smaller time periods. As long as you select the same tree after each break, it would continue to grow until it is complete. That way, you are getting the full perks of focusing and still doing it in a healthy and optimal way.",
