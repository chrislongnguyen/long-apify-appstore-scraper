    "text": "THIS APP IS ABOUT ADVANCED AS A 3rd GRADE MATH TEST. Do not even try the free trial because you won’t be able to find how to log out of it or stop them from robbing you because there’s no menu or home or account icon in the app.  You think that’s an accident ? SCAM ! They at least could have made the app a little bit usable but any ai platform performs artwork better and is free.",
