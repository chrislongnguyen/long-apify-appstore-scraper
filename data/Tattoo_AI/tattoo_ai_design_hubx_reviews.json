You have to be incredibly literal. For example, if you’re born in July, you have to tell the tool that you are a cancer.. You even have to say that you’re looking for the zodiac. Otherwise, it will consider cancer a disease and provide you only skulls. It has a long way to go to be effective. Horrible.",
