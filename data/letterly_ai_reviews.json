    "text": "As an early adopter, this app has been outstanding to use. I strongly recommend it for anyone who is dyslexic or has any issues conveying their thoughts in writing clearly. I've used many AI apps. There's nothing quite like Letterly. To be able to open my phone, record a voice memo, and come back to it later has been outstanding. I've created a couple custom prompts that I use on a regular basis like TLDR or tone changing or removing the ums. And because I'm using a lot of dictation, there are a couple ums that make their way into my voice transcripts. So, if you're on the fence about an app that will allow you to convey consistent communication written, just get this app. It's great!",

It’s perfect if I just need the audio, a transcript, a summary, or any combination thereof.  It is so easy to use and I love the user interface.  With each iteration of new features, it makes it more and more valuable.      Keep up the good work.  I have very few apps that rise to “go-to” status and this is definitely on the short list.",
